    "When we look at a source whose spectrum is $F_\\lambda(\\lambda)$, our eyes are basically calculating three integrals of that spectrum over wavelength. We perceive different colors as different ratios among these three integrals. Let's write some code to approximate these integrals, so we can display spectra as colors on our computer screens. Flux integrals like these pop up [all the time](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2005ARA&A..43..293B/abstract) in astronomy, where we talk about flux through broadband photometric filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to know the effective response of the cones in our eyes to different wavelengths of light. We can approximate these using three \"color matching functions\" $\\bar{x}(\\lambda)$, $\\bar{y}(\\lambda)$, and $\\bar{z}(\\lambda)$.  The file `ciexyz31.txt` contains a table of these three functions. Load in these color matching functions, and use them to calculate the following three quantities:\n",

You can think of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ roughly as the brightness of three colored lamps (\"pseudo-red\", \"pseudo-green\", \"pseudo-blue\") which all mix together to form the final color. However, these pseudo-colors aren't exactly the RGB (\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\") colors that our screens display. To get to actual RGB values, these need to be stretched and squeezed a little bit through a linear matrix transformation. The function `xyz2rgb` below handles this conversion for you. \n",
